To use TriviaCrackGod, you must first have the following packages:
  requests (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install)

HOWTO:
  Step 1: Open a browser window to TriviaCrack (https://apps.facebook.com/triviacrack/) 
  Step 2: Authenticate using Facebook account (note that this is the only way of playing TC on a computer)
  Step 3: Locate the cookie named "ap_session" (use developer console)
  Step 4: Open the script in an editor and add your "ap_session" value to the session string
  Step 5: Use developer console again, this time view your user_id in the dashboard requests ("dashboard" in the network tab)
  Step 6: Set user_id to your own id.
  Step 7: Run the script
  Step 8: Follow the command prompt

NOTES:
  Be sure to re-enter your ap_session every time you reset your session.
  Leave the window with TC open while using script
